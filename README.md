## About

This project was built following a couple of weeks of studying javascript concepts and implementing it with my React knowledge. I've been following Wes Bos' beginner javascript course: https://beginnerjavascript.com/

Some of the things I studied were refreshers but below is a list of things I learned which I worked to implement in this project. 

[x] - Implicit return vs Explicit return
[x] - Toggle active and inactive classes
[x] - using element.closest() to find nearest parent element to a specified element
[x] - Using element.querySelectorAll()
[x] - Adding and removing event listeners
[x] - Using a div as a button
[x] - Using keycodes for events
[x] - CSS animations 
[x] - Input event handlers
[x] - Array.map()
[x] - Array.filter()
[x] - Template literals
[x] - Using React Hooks
[x] - Fetching from an API

Other things I have learned which I have not yet implemented into this project:

[] - default arguments
[] - setting attributes
[] - using data attributes
[] - stopping propogation
[] - using parseInt() and parseFloat()
[] - Math.ceil vs Math.floor vs Math.round
[] - Object.freeze()
[] - Using Maps

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
